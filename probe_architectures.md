## 3.1 Baseline Probe Architectures

We first describe probe architectures from prior work that serve as our baselines.

### 3.1.1 Linear Probes

Linear probes were first introduced by Alain and Bengio, 2016. Given **w** ∈ ℝ^d, mean pooled linear probes are defined as:

$$f_{\text{Linear}}(S_i) = \frac{1}{n_i} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}_{i,j}$$

so are very simple in terms of the steps 1) – 6) in Figure 2. Spelled out, for linear probes the transformation is just the identity map, H = 1, the scores are a simple linear map, and aggregation is just the mean.

### 3.1.2 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Probes

EMA probes were proposed by Cunningham, Peng, et al., 2025 as a way to improve probe generalization to long contexts. To use an EMA probe, we first train a mean probe f_linear as in Equation (3). Then, at inference time, we compute an exponential moving average at each index j = 1, ..., n_i:

$$\text{EMA}_0 = 0; \quad \text{EMA}_j = \alpha f_{\text{linear}}(\mathbf{x}_{i,j}) + (1 - \alpha)\text{EMA}_{j-1}$$

for α ∈ (0, 1). Following Cunningham, Peng, et al., 2025, we use α = 0.5. We then take the maximum over EMA scores to get f_EMA(S_i) = max_j EMA_j which is the final probe score.

### 3.1.3 MLP Probes

MLP probes (e.g. Zou, Phan, J. Wang, et al. (2024)) are the same as linear probes except that we apply an MLP to the pooled or single token activation vector before multiplying by **q**. Using the definition of an M layer (ReLU) MLP as:

$$\text{MLP}_M(\mathbf{X}) = A_1 \cdot \text{ReLU}(A_2 \cdot \text{ReLU}(\ldots \text{ReLU}(A_M \cdot \mathbf{X}) \ldots))$$

an M-layer mean pooled MLP probe is formally defined as:

$$f^M_{\text{MLP}}(S_i) = \frac{1}{n_i} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \text{MLP}_M(\mathbf{x}_{i,j})$$

with the dimensions of A_1, ..., A_M chosen such that the final result is a scalar.

### 3.1.4 Attention Probes

The single head attention probe was first introduced by Kantamneni et al., 2025, further used by McKenzie et al., 2025, and expanded to use multiple heads by Shabalin and Belrose, 2025. In our work, we first pass activations through a common MLP before computing attention. Specifically, we define:

$$\mathbf{y}_{i,j} = \text{MLP}_M(\mathbf{x}_{i,j})$$

where MLP_M is an M-layer MLP as defined in Equation (5). An H-headed attention probe is then defined as:

$$f_{\text{Attn}}(S_i) = \sum_{h=1}^{H} \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \exp(\mathbf{q}_h^\top \mathbf{y}_{i,j}) \cdot (\mathbf{v}_h^\top \mathbf{y}_{i,j})}{\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \exp(\mathbf{q}_h^\top \mathbf{y}_{i,j})}$$

where **q**_h, **v**_h ∈ ℝ^d' are learned query and value vectors for head h, and d' is the output dimension of the MLP. Note that this is the first probe where the aggregation weights are a function of the activations themselves rather than constants, illustrated by the looping upper arrow in Figure 2.

One might naively think that attention probes require an expensive recomputation of the softmax function for every new token during generation. But this is false, and as an additional contribution we present an inexpensive inference algorithm for attention probes in Appendix L.

## 3.2 Our Probe Architectures

We now present our novel probe architectures designed to address the limitations of baseline methods, particularly for long-context generalization.

### 3.2.1 MultiMax Probes

We find that the attention probe's softmax weighting suffers from overtriggering on long contexts (see Section 5.1). To address this, we propose the MultiMax architecture, which replaces the softmax with a hard max at inference time (though not always during training). Using the same MLP-transformed activations **y** as above:

$$f_{\text{MultiMax}}(S_i) = \sum_{h=1}^{H} \max_{j \in [n_i]} \left( \mathbf{v}_h^\top \mathbf{y}_{i,j} \right)$$

where **v**_h ∈ ℝ^d' are learned value vectors for each head h. Unlike attention probes, MultiMax selects the single highest-scoring token per head rather than computing a weighted average, which prevents dilution of the signal when harmful content appears in a small portion of a long context.

### 3.2.2 Max of Rolling Means Attention Probe

In prior work, McKenzie et al. (2025) introduce the Max of Rolling Means probe which takes the max over all mean scores of all possible windows of contiguous tokens of a fixed length in a sequence. In our work, we combine this with an Attention Probe, using the lessons learnt from the MultiMax probe work. Specifically, we use 10 attention heads by default and compute attention-weighted averages within sliding rectangular windows of fixed width w (we use w = 10 as default). For each window ending at position t, we compute:

$$\bar{v}_t = \frac{\sum_{j=t-w+1}^{t} \alpha_j \cdot v_j}{\sum_{j=t-w+1}^{t} \alpha_j}$$

where α_j = softmax(**q**^⊤ **y**_j) are the attention weights and v_j = **v**^⊤ **y**_j are the per-token values. The final output is max_t v̄_t. In this work, we explore using this aggregation at evaluation time, in addition to the simpler MultiMax aggregation described in Section 3.2.1.

### 3.2.3 AlphaEvolve Architectures

We additionally experiment with running AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al., 2025) to generate novel probing architectures. We start with an attention probe (Section 3.1.4) as our seed model (since this is already an existing architecture) and use weighted FPR and FNR as our optimization target (we use somewhat of a different weighting to either Equation (12) and Appendix K due to using AlphaEvolve early in this research project, see Appendix F.1). We choose two of the architectures AlphaEvolve discovered as additional methods to compare to and include pseudocode for these two architectures in Appendix F.2.
